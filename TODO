TODO list for EIRCC and Lui development                           -*-outline-*-

* eircc.el
- display-MODE as well: If setter is server and
  `eircc-netsplit-ignore-server-modes' is non-nil, ignore it

** Future Extensions:
- auto-away. On every message from the server, check.
- buttonize: For urls, `fnord' help functions, RFC [0-9]+, SRFI[- ][0-9]+
- dcc

* lui.el
- highlight: If highlight face is 'ignore, set lui-ignore property instead?
- Functions to check/modify the stuff we send ("wether")
- Allow tracking per-frame: When the buffer is visible nowhere, or
  when it is just not visible on this frame
- Kill ring needs improvement
- A way to ignore certain buffers from tracking

- lui-irc-colors.el:
  - lui-irc-colors-enable function

** Future Extensions:
- logging
- emacspeak support

* Emacs release
After the next Emacs release, fix the following stuff:

- ?  (i.e. the space character) can now be ?\s
- eircc-channel-parse-names can now use the third argument to
  `split-string' and stop worrying about `delete'
- lui-complete can stop turning completions into alists for
  `try-completion'
