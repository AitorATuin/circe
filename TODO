TODO list for Circe and Lui development                           -*-outline-*-

Website:
- Make new screenshots
- Mention version number after the next release

Code:
- circe.el: display-MODE: If setter is server and
  `circe-netsplit-ignore-server-modes' is non-nil, ignore it
- circe.el: Counter for reconnects; set to 0 on successful connect,
  increment on each reconnect, if above
  `circe-server-max-reconnect-attempts', stop.
- circe.el: Face for "message originator"
- circe-highlight-nicks.el: Extension to highlight all nicks in the
  channel in the current message
- circe.el: flyspell should ignore nicks in the current channel (Not
  easily possible?)
- lui.el: Functions to check/modify the stuff we send ("wether")
- lui.el: Allow tracking per-frame: When the buffer is visible
  nowhere, or when it is just not visible on this frame
- lui.el: Kill ring needs improvement
- lui.el: A way to ignore certain buffers from tracking
- lui-irc-colors.el:
  - lui-irc-colors-enable function
- lui.el: Improve the 'ignored stuff, and add it to circe again.
  We'll need two ignore lists there, though. (/fool and /unfool)

** Future Extensions:
- circe.el: auto-away. On every message from the server, check.
- lui.el: buttonize: For urls, `fnord' help functions, RFC [0-9]+,
  SRFI[- ][0-9]+ (Extend lui-highlight-keywords for this?)
- dcc
- lui-logging.el: logging
- lui-speak.el: emacspeak support

* Emacs release
After the next Emacs release, fix the following stuff:

- ?  (i.e. the space character) can now be ?\s
- circe-channel-parse-names can now use the third argument to
  `split-string' and stop worrying about `delete'
- lui-complete can stop turning completions into alists for
  `try-completion'
