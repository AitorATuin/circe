TODO list for Circe and Lui development                           -*-outline-*-

* Pre Version 1:
- lui.texi
- NEWS, ChangeLog

* Release Version 1:
- savannah: Upload file (cf.
  https://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group_id=5802&question=Download_Area_-_How_do_I_add_files.txt)
- website: Mention version number
- website: Link to downloadable file
- savannah: Add news item about release
- savannah: Set 5 - Production/Stable

* Post Version 1:
- Think of a release schedule (Idea: Every 3 months as single-release;
  when we reach the current year, switch to double-digit (so we have
  y.1-y.4 per year); use .n for subreleases anyways. Worst case:
  5.4.1)
  Consider mandatory ChangeLog
  NEWS file for all user-visible changes
  <aj> having the user visible description be in the patch's long
    description, marked by ***'s say, would let you generate NEWS by
    "darcs changes | grep '\*\*\*'" and not have that problem, fwiw
- irclib.el ?
- debian/
- circe-query-rename
- Create -mode-maps for all modes.
- circe.el: Highlight finds "forcer-" for nick "forcer". Is that
  wanted?
- circe.el: Use non-blocking connects
- circe.el: Allow a server list which is tried in turn to see whether
  one of them works.
- Circe Channel Keys: http://paste.lisp.org/display/10696
- lui.el: Kill ring needs improvement (see comments)
- lui.el: Improve the 'ignored stuff, and add it to circe again.
  We'll need two ignore lists there, though. (/fool and /unfool)
  Store the ignored stuff in a text property? Does that keep overlays?
  If not, walk the area and hide/unhide overlays as well.
  Maybe even use a lui-ignored-face as a way to recognize them? (=> Darken
  as possibility)
- circe.el: auto-away. On every message from the server, check. Also,
  auto-back
- lui.el: buttonize: For urls, `fnord' help functions, RFC [0-9]+,
  SRFI[- ][0-9]+ (Extend lui-highlight-keywords for this?)
- lui-logging.el: logging

** Future Extensions:
- dcc
- lui-speak.el: emacspeak support

* Wishlist
- circe.el: flyspell should ignore nicks in the current channel
  - This is not easily possible, sadly. It would require managing a
    private dictionary file per channel.
  - The alternative is similar to `ispell-buffer-local-words'

* Emacs release
After the next Emacs release, fix the following stuff:

- ?  (i.e. the space character) can now be ?\s
- circe-channel-parse-names can now use the third argument to
  `split-string' and stop worrying about `delete'
- lui-complete can stop turning completions into alists for
  `try-completion'
- Use `ignore-errors' instead of some of the `unwind-protect's
