Frequently Asked Questions about Circe, a Client for IRC on Emacs -*-outline-*-

* General
Q: Why doesn't Circe re-use old channel buffers after the server
   buffer got killed?
A: It is not possible to find out whether we can use that channel
   buffer or not. Doing heuristics will lead to severe confusion when
   the user connects to the same server twice. So we don't do this.
   Use the `circe-reconnect' command in any Circe buffer to reconnect
   to this server.

Q: Can Circe do logging?
A: This is on the agenda, but not yet implemented. In the meantime,
   you can use the following code snippet:

   (defvar my-lui-log-directory "~/.logs"
     "Directory to place log files.")
   (defun my-lui-logging ()
     "Log the current information to an appropriate file."
     (let ((string (buffer-substring (point-min)
                                     (point-max))))
       (with-temp-buffer
         (insert (format "%s %s\n"
                         (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                         string))
         (append-to-file (point-min)
                         (point-max)
                         (concat my-lui-log-directory
                                 "/"
                                 (replace-regexp-in-string
                                  "\\(\\.\\.\\|/\\)"
                                  "_"
                                  circe-chat-target))))))

Q: Why does switching to some Circe buffers hang Emacs for a moment?
A: That's because you enabled flyspell for Circe, and ispell.el is so
   intelligent as to start a new spelling process each time the
   dictionary changes. Aspell takes much longer to start than ispell,
   so you could just use ispell...


* XEmacs
Q: How do I use Circe in XEmacs?
A: Use (require 'circe-xemacs) instead of (require 'circe).

Q: Why can't I use the (circe "irc.freenode.net" "6667") on XEmacs?
A: XEmacs doesn't like a port as a string argument there. Please use
   an for this in that environment.
